module Stripe
  # For new subscriptions, a future timestamp to anchor the subscription's [billing cycle](https://stripe.com/docs/subscriptions/billing-cycle). This is used to determine the date of the first full invoice, and, for plans with `month` or `year` intervals, the day of the month for subsequent invoices. For existing subscriptions, the value can only be set to `now` or `unchanged`.
