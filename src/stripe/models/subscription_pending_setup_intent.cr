  # You can use this [SetupIntent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/setup_intents) to collect user authentication when creating a subscription without immediate payment or updating a subscription's payment method, allowing you to optimize for off-session payments. Learn more in the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#scenario-2).
