    # Optional properties

    # Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent's payment method.  Providing this parameter will [attach the payment method](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/save-during-payment) to the PaymentIntent's Customer, if present, after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete. If no Customer was provided, the payment method can still be [attached](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods/attach) to a Customer after the transaction completes.  When processing card payments, Stripe also uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication).
