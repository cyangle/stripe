module Stripe
  # A recent IP address of the customer used for tax reporting and tax location inference. Stripe recommends updating the IP address when a new PaymentMethod is attached or the address field on the customer is updated. We recommend against updating this field more frequently since it could result in unexpected tax location/reporting outcomes.
