module Stripe
  # If this is a `card` PaymentMethod, this hash contains the user's card details. For backwards compatibility, you can alternatively provide a Stripe token (e.g., for Apple Pay, Amex Express Checkout, or legacy Checkout) into the card hash with format `card: {token: \"tok_visa\"}`. When providing a card number, you must meet the requirements for [PCI compliance](https://stripe.com/docs/security#validating-pci-compliance). We strongly recommend using Stripe.js instead of interacting with this API directly.
