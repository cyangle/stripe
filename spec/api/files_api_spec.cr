  # unit tests for get_files
  # &lt;p&gt;Returns a list of the files that your account has access to. The files are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recently created files appearing first.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :ending_before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;ending_before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with &#x60;obj_bar&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;ending_before&#x3D;obj_bar&#x60; in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
  # @option opts [String] :starting_after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;starting_after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with &#x60;obj_foo&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;starting_after&#x3D;obj_foo&#x60; in order to fetch the next page of the list.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @option opts [String] :purpose The file purpose to filter queries by. If none is provided, files will not be filtered by purpose.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :created
  # @return [FileFileList]

  # unit tests for post_files
  # &lt;p&gt;To upload a file to Stripe, you’ll need to send a request of type &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt;. The request should contain the file you would like to upload, as well as the parameters for creating a file.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of Stripe’s officially supported Client libraries should have support for sending &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
