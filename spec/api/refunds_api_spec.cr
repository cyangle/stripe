  # unit tests for get_refunds
  # &lt;p&gt;Returns a list of all refunds youâ€™ve previously created. The refunds are returned in sorted order, with the most recent refunds appearing first. For convenience, the 10 most recent refunds are always available by default on the charge object.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :ending_before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;ending_before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with &#x60;obj_bar&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;ending_before&#x3D;obj_bar&#x60; in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
  # @option opts [String] :starting_after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;starting_after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with &#x60;obj_foo&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;starting_after&#x3D;obj_foo&#x60; in order to fetch the next page of the list.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [String] :payment_intent Only return refunds for the PaymentIntent specified by this ID.
  # @option opts [String] :charge Only return refunds for the charge specified by this charge ID.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :created
  # @return [RefundList]
