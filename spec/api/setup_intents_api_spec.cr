  # &lt;p&gt;Returns a list of SetupIntents.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :ending_before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;ending_before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with &#x60;obj_bar&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;ending_before&#x3D;obj_bar&#x60; in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
  # @option opts [String] :starting_after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;starting_after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with &#x60;obj_foo&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;starting_after&#x3D;obj_foo&#x60; in order to fetch the next page of the list.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :created A filter on the list, based on the object &#x60;created&#x60; field. The value can be a string with an integer Unix timestamp, or it can be a dictionary with a number of different query options.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [Bool] :attach_to_self If present, the SetupIntent&#39;s payment method will be attached to the in-context Stripe Account.  It can only be used for this Stripe Account’s own money movement flows like InboundTransfer and OutboundTransfers. It cannot be set to true when setting up a PaymentMethod for a Customer, and defaults to false when attaching a PaymentMethod to a Customer.
  # @option opts [String] :customer Only return SetupIntents for the customer specified by this customer ID.
  # @option opts [String] :payment_method Only return SetupIntents that associate with the specified payment method.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @return [PaymentFlowsSetupIntentList]

  # &lt;p&gt;Creates a SetupIntent object.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After you create the SetupIntent, attach a payment method and &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/docs/api/setup_intents/confirm\&quot;&gt;confirm&lt;/a&gt; it to collect any required permissions to charge the payment method later.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Bool] :attach_to_self If present, the SetupIntent&#39;s payment method will be attached to the in-context Stripe Account.  It can only be used for this Stripe Account’s own money movement flows like InboundTransfer and OutboundTransfers. It cannot be set to true when setting up a PaymentMethod for a Customer, and defaults to false when attaching a PaymentMethod to a Customer.
  # @option opts [AutomaticPaymentMethodsParam] :automatic_payment_methods
  # @option opts [Bool] :confirm Set to &#x60;true&#x60; to attempt to confirm this SetupIntent immediately. This parameter defaults to &#x60;false&#x60;. If a card is the attached payment method, you can provide a &#x60;return_url&#x60; in case further authentication is necessary.
  # @option opts [String] :confirmation_token ID of the ConfirmationToken used to confirm this SetupIntent.  If the provided ConfirmationToken contains properties that are also being provided in this request, such as &#x60;payment_method&#x60;, then the values in this request will take precedence.
  # @option opts [String] :customer ID of the Customer this SetupIntent belongs to, if one exists.  If present, the SetupIntent&#39;s payment method will be attached to the Customer on successful setup. Payment methods attached to other Customers cannot be used with this SetupIntent.
  # @option opts [String] :description An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :flow_directions Indicates the directions of money movement for which this payment method is intended to be used.  Include &#x60;inbound&#x60; if you intend to use the payment method as the origin to pull funds from. Include &#x60;outbound&#x60; if you intend to use the payment method as the destination to send funds to. You can include both if you intend to use the payment method for both purposes.
  # @option opts [PostSetupIntentsRequestMandateData] :mandate_data
  # @option opts [Hash(String, String)] :metadata
  # @option opts [String] :on_behalf_of The Stripe account ID created for this SetupIntent.

  # @option opts [Array(String)] :payment_method_types The list of payment method types (for example, card) that this SetupIntent can use. If you don&#39;t provide this, it defaults to [\\\&quot;card\\\&quot;].
  # @option opts [String] :return_url The URL to redirect your customer back to after they authenticate or cancel their payment on the payment method&#39;s app or site. To redirect to a mobile application, you can alternatively supply an application URI scheme. This parameter can only be used with [&#x60;confirm&#x3D;true&#x60;](https://stripe.com/docs/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-confirm).
  # @option opts [SetupIntentSingleUseParams] :single_use
  # @option opts [String] :usage Indicates how the payment method is intended to be used in the future. If not provided, this value defaults to &#x60;off_session&#x60;.

  # &lt;p&gt;Confirm that your customer intends to set up the current or provided payment method. For example, you would confirm a SetupIntent when a customer hits the “Save” button on a payment method management page on your website.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the selected payment method does not require any additional steps from the customer, the SetupIntent will transition to the &lt;code&gt;succeeded&lt;/code&gt; status.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it will transition to the &lt;code&gt;requires_action&lt;/code&gt; status and suggest additional actions via &lt;code&gt;next_action&lt;/code&gt;.
