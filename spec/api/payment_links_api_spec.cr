  # &lt;p&gt;Returns a list of your payment links.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :ending_before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;ending_before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with &#x60;obj_bar&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;ending_before&#x3D;obj_bar&#x60; in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
  # @option opts [String] :starting_after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;starting_after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with &#x60;obj_foo&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;starting_after&#x3D;obj_foo&#x60; in order to fetch the next page of the list.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [Bool] :active Only return payment links that are active or inactive (e.g., pass &#x60;false&#x60; to list all inactive payment links).
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
