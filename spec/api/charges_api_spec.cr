  # unit tests for get_charges
  # &lt;p&gt;Returns a list of charges you’ve previously created. The charges are returned in sorted order, with the most recent charges appearing first.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :ending_before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;ending_before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with &#x60;obj_bar&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;ending_before&#x3D;obj_bar&#x60; in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
  # @option opts [String] :starting_after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;starting_after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with &#x60;obj_foo&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;starting_after&#x3D;obj_foo&#x60; in order to fetch the next page of the list.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [String] :customer Only return charges for the customer specified by this customer ID.
  # @option opts [String] :transfer_group Only return charges for this transfer group, limited to 100.
  # @option opts [String] :payment_intent Only return charges that were created by the PaymentIntent specified by this PaymentIntent ID.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :created Only return charges that were created during the given date interval.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.

  # unit tests for get_charges_search
  # &lt;p&gt;Search for charges you’ve previously created using Stripe’s &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/docs/search#search-query-language\&quot;&gt;Search Query Language&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t use search in read-after-write flows where strict consistency is necessary. Under normal operating conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally, propagation of new or updated data can be up to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available to merchants in India.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param query The search query string. See [search query language](https://stripe.com/docs/search#search-query-language) and the list of supported [query fields for charges](https://stripe.com/docs/search#query-fields-for-charges).
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :page A cursor for pagination across multiple pages of results. Don&#39;t include this parameter on the first call. Use the next_page value returned in a previous response to request subsequent results.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.

  # unit tests for post_charges
  # &lt;p&gt;This method is no longer recommended—use the &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/docs/api/payment_intents\&quot;&gt;Payment Intents API&lt;/a&gt; to initiate a new payment instead. Confirmation of the PaymentIntent creates the &lt;code&gt;Charge&lt;/code&gt; object used to request payment.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Int32] :amount Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#zero-decimal) (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts). The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999 for a USD charge of $999,999.99).
  # @option opts [Int32] :application_fee
  # @option opts [Int32] :application_fee_amount A fee in cents (or local equivalent) that will be applied to the charge and transferred to the application owner&#39;s Stripe account. The request must be made with an OAuth key or the &#x60;Stripe-Account&#x60; header in order to take an application fee. For more information, see the application fees [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees).
  # @option opts [Bool] :capture Whether to immediately capture the charge. Defaults to &#x60;true&#x60;. When &#x60;false&#x60;, the charge issues an authorization (or pre-authorization), and will need to be [captured](https://stripe.com/docs/api#capture_charge) later. Uncaptured charges expire after a set number of days (7 by default). For more information, see the [authorizing charges and settling later](https://stripe.com/docs/charges/placing-a-hold) documentation.
  # @option opts [String] :currency Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).
  # @option opts [String] :customer The ID of an existing customer that will be charged in this request.
  # @option opts [String] :description An arbitrary string which you can attach to a &#x60;Charge&#x60; object. It is displayed when in the web interface alongside the charge. Note that if you use Stripe to send automatic email receipts to your customers, your receipt emails will include the &#x60;description&#x60; of the charge(s) that they are describing.
  # @option opts [DestinationSpecs] :destination
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @option opts [PostAccountsRequestMetadata] :metadata
  # @option opts [String] :on_behalf_of The Stripe account ID for which these funds are intended. Automatically set if you use the &#x60;destination&#x60; parameter. For details, see [Creating Separate Charges and Transfers](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#settlement-merchant).
  # @option opts [RadarOptionsWithHiddenOptions] :radar_options
  # @option opts [String] :receipt_email The email address to which this charge&#39;s [receipt](https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard/receipts) will be sent. The receipt will not be sent until the charge is paid, and no receipts will be sent for test mode charges. If this charge is for a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object), the email address specified here will override the customer&#39;s email address. If &#x60;receipt_email&#x60; is specified for a charge in live mode, a receipt will be sent regardless of your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).
  # @option opts [OptionalFieldsShipping] :shipping
  # @option opts [String] :source A payment source to be charged. This can be the ID of a [card](https://stripe.com/docs/api#cards) (i.e., credit or debit card), a [bank account](https://stripe.com/docs/api#bank_accounts), a [source](https://stripe.com/docs/api#sources), a [token](https://stripe.com/docs/api#tokens), or a [connected account](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/account-debits#charging-a-connected-account). For certain sources---namely, [cards](https://stripe.com/docs/api#cards), [bank accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#bank_accounts), and attached [sources](https://stripe.com/docs/api#sources)---you must also pass the ID of the associated customer.
  # @option opts [String] :statement_descriptor For a non-card charge, text that appears on the customer&#39;s statement as the statement descriptor. This value overrides the account&#39;s default statement descriptor. For information about requirements, including the 22-character limit, see [the Statement Descriptor docs](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).  For a card charge, this value is ignored unless you don&#39;t specify a &#x60;statement_descriptor_suffix&#x60;, in which case this value is used as the suffix.
  # @option opts [String] :statement_descriptor_suffix Provides information about a card charge. Concatenated to the account&#39;s [statement descriptor prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#static) to form the complete statement descriptor that appears on the customer&#39;s statement. If the account has no prefix value, the suffix is concatenated to the account&#39;s statement descriptor.
  # @option opts [TransferDataSpecs] :transfer_data
  # @option opts [String] :transfer_group A string that identifies this transaction as part of a group. For details, see [Grouping transactions](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-options).

  # @option opts [String] :customer The ID of an existing customer that will be associated with this request. This field may only be updated if there is no existing associated customer with this charge.
  # @option opts [String] :description An arbitrary string which you can attach to a charge object. It is displayed when in the web interface alongside the charge. Note that if you use Stripe to send automatic email receipts to your customers, your receipt emails will include the &#x60;description&#x60; of the charge(s) that they are describing.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @option opts [FraudDetails] :fraud_details
  # @option opts [PostAccountsRequestMetadata] :metadata
  # @option opts [String] :receipt_email This is the email address that the receipt for this charge will be sent to. If this field is updated, then a new email receipt will be sent to the updated address.
  # @option opts [OptionalFieldsShipping] :shipping
  # @option opts [String] :transfer_group A string that identifies this transaction as part of a group. &#x60;transfer_group&#x60; may only be provided if it has not been set.

  # unit tests for post_charges_charge_capture
  # &lt;p&gt;Capture the payment of an existing, uncaptured charge that was created with the &lt;code&gt;capture&lt;/code&gt; option set to false.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Uncaptured payments expire a set number of days after they are created (&lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/docs/charges/placing-a-hold\&quot;&gt;7 by default&lt;/a&gt;), after which they are marked as refunded and capture attempts will fail.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don’t use this method to capture a PaymentIntent-initiated charge. Use &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/docs/api/payment_intents/capture\&quot;&gt;Capture a PaymentIntent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param charge
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
