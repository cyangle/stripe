  # unit tests for get_payouts
  # &lt;p&gt;Returns a list of existing payouts sent to third-party bank accounts or payouts that Stripe sent to you. The payouts return in sorted order, with the most recently created payouts appearing first.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :ending_before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;ending_before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with &#x60;obj_bar&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;ending_before&#x3D;obj_bar&#x60; in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
  # @option opts [String] :starting_after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;starting_after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with &#x60;obj_foo&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;starting_after&#x3D;obj_foo&#x60; in order to fetch the next page of the list.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :arrival_date Only return payouts that are expected to arrive during the given date interval.
  # @option opts [String] :status Only return payouts that have the given status: &#x60;pending&#x60;, &#x60;paid&#x60;, &#x60;failed&#x60;, or &#x60;canceled&#x60;.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :created Only return payouts that were created during the given date interval.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @option opts [String] :destination The ID of an external account - only return payouts sent to this external account.
  # @return [PayoutList]

  # unit tests for post_payouts
  # &lt;p&gt;To send funds to your own bank account, create a new payout object. Your &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;#balance\&quot;&gt;Stripe balance&lt;/a&gt; must cover the payout amount. If it doesn’t, you receive an “Insufficient Funds” error.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If your API key is in test mode, money won’t actually be sent, though every other action occurs as if you’re in live mode.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you create a manual payout on a Stripe account that uses multiple payment source types, you need to specify the source type balance that the payout draws from. The &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;#balance_object\&quot;&gt;balance object&lt;/a&gt; details available and pending amounts by source type.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param amount A positive integer in cents representing how much to payout.
  # @param currency Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :description An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.
  # @option opts [String] :destination The ID of a bank account or a card to send the payout to. If you don&#39;t provide a destination, we use the default external account for the specified currency.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @option opts [Hash(String, String)] :metadata
  # @option opts [String] :method The method used to send this payout, which is &#x60;standard&#x60; or &#x60;instant&#x60;. We support &#x60;instant&#x60; for payouts to debit cards and bank accounts in certain countries. Learn more about [bank support for Instant Payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts/instant-payouts-banks).
  # @option opts [String] :source_type The balance type of your Stripe balance to draw this payout from. Balances for different payment sources are kept separately. You can find the amounts with the Balances API. One of &#x60;bank_account&#x60;, &#x60;card&#x60;, or &#x60;fpx&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :statement_descriptor A string that displays on the recipient&#39;s bank or card statement (up to 22 characters). A &#x60;statement_descriptor&#x60; that&#39;s longer than 22 characters return an error. Most banks truncate this information and display it inconsistently. Some banks might not display it at all.

  # unit tests for post_payouts_payout_cancel
  # &lt;p&gt;You can cancel a previously created payout if its status is &lt;code&gt;pending&lt;/code&gt;. Stripe refunds the funds to your available balance. You can’t cancel automatic Stripe payouts.&lt;/p&gt;

  # unit tests for post_payouts_payout_reverse
  # &lt;p&gt;Reverses a payout by debiting the destination bank account. At this time, you can only reverse payouts for connected accounts to US bank accounts. If the payout is manual and in the &lt;code&gt;pending&lt;/code&gt; status, use &lt;code&gt;/v1/payouts/:id/cancel&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By requesting a reversal through &lt;code&gt;/v1/payouts/:id/reverse&lt;/code&gt;, you confirm that the authorized signatory of the selected bank account authorizes the debit on the bank account and that no other authorization is required.&lt;/p&gt;
