  # unit tests for get_setup_attempts
  # &lt;p&gt;Returns a list of SetupAttempts associated with a provided SetupIntent.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param setup_intent Only return SetupAttempts created by the SetupIntent specified by this ID.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :ending_before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;ending_before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with &#x60;obj_bar&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;ending_before&#x3D;obj_bar&#x60; in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
  # @option opts [String] :starting_after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;starting_after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with &#x60;obj_foo&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;starting_after&#x3D;obj_foo&#x60; in order to fetch the next page of the list.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :created A filter on the list, based on the object &#x60;created&#x60; field. The value can be a string with an integer Unix timestamp, or it can be a dictionary with a number of different query options.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @return [PaymentFlowsSetupIntentSetupAttemptList]
