  # unit tests for get_subscription_schedules
  # &lt;p&gt;Retrieves the list of your subscription schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :ending_before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;ending_before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with &#x60;obj_bar&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;ending_before&#x3D;obj_bar&#x60; in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
  # @option opts [String] :starting_after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;starting_after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with &#x60;obj_foo&#x60;, your subsequent call can include &#x60;starting_after&#x3D;obj_foo&#x60; in order to fetch the next page of the list.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  # @option opts [String] :customer Only return subscription schedules for the given customer.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :completed_at Only return subscription schedules that completed during the given date interval.
  # @option opts [Bool] :scheduled Only return subscription schedules that have not started yet.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :canceled_at Only return subscription schedules that were created canceled the given date interval.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :created Only return subscription schedules that were created during the given date interval.
  # @option opts [GetAccountsCreatedParameter] :released_at Only return subscription schedules that were released during the given date interval.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @return [SubscriptionSchedulesResourceScheduleList]

  # unit tests for post_subscription_schedules
  # &lt;p&gt;Creates a new subscription schedule object. Each customer can have up to 500 active or scheduled subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :customer The identifier of the customer to create the subscription schedule for.
  # @option opts [DefaultSettingsParams] :default_settings
  # @option opts [String] :end_behavior Configures how the subscription schedule behaves when it ends. Possible values are &#x60;release&#x60; or &#x60;cancel&#x60; with the default being &#x60;release&#x60;. &#x60;release&#x60; will end the subscription schedule and keep the underlying subscription running.&#x60;cancel&#x60; will end the subscription schedule and cancel the underlying subscription.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :expand Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  # @option opts [String] :from_subscription Migrate an existing subscription to be managed by a subscription schedule. If this parameter is set, a subscription schedule will be created using the subscription&#39;s item(s), set to auto-renew using the subscription&#39;s interval. When using this parameter, other parameters (such as phase values) cannot be set. To create a subscription schedule with other modifications, we recommend making two separate API calls.
  # @option opts [PostAccountsRequestMetadata] :metadata
  # @option opts [Array(PhaseConfigurationParams)] :phases List representing phases of the subscription schedule. Each phase can be customized to have different durations, plans, and coupons. If there are multiple phases, the &#x60;end_date&#x60; of one phase will always equal the &#x60;start_date&#x60; of the next phase.

  # &lt;p&gt;Cancels a subscription schedule and its associated subscription immediately (if the subscription schedule has an active subscription). A subscription schedule can only be canceled if its status is &lt;code&gt;not_started&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
